My solutions for the coding challenges put out by Tech Chapter for apprentice applicants at: https://github.com/techchapter/apprentice-challenge

The general code framework and tests have been provided from there.

I have done the implementation of the methods for the respective classes in HolidayCalendar.cs, Validator.cs, and Menu.cs
